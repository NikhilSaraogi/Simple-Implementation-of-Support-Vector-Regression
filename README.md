My task is to predict whether a bank currency note is authentic or not based upon four attributes of the note i.e. skewness of the wavelet transformed image, variance of the image, entropy of the image, and kurtosis of the image. This is a binary classification problem and Iâ€™m using SVM algorithm to solve this problem
